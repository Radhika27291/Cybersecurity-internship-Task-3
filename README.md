While capturing live network traffic using Wireshark, it was observed that opening a website generates multiple network packets related to TCP, UDP, DNS, HTTP, and HTTPS protocols. The three-way TCP handshake was clearly seen through SYN, SYN-ACK, and ACK packets, confirming that TCP establishes a reliable connection before data transfer. HTTP traffic showed some information in plain text, whereas HTTPS traffic appeared encrypted, highlighting the importance of secure communication. DNS analysis revealed that domain names are sent in plain text to DNS servers using UDP port 53, and multiple DNS queries are generated for a single website due to external resources. These observations demonstrate how network traffic flows and why monitoring it is important for cyber security.
